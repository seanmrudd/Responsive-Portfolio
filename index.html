            <p>
                Hello everyone!  My legal name is Sean, but all my friends and family call me...Sean.  I'm a Florida native from
                the great city of Stuart, FL.  I moved to Orlando, Fl the first time to attend
                the University of Central Florida where I received my bachelor's degree in criminal
                justice.  Since then, I moved around quite a bit, just to find myself back
                here in Orlando.  I am currently employeed with Moe's Southwest Grill as an area manager.  What was supposed
                to be a college job turned into more raises and promotions till I found myself as a key figure in the operations
                of my franchise.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently taking classes to learn how to code through UCF's Coding Bootcamp.  It has proven to be quite
                challenging, however it is very interesting and I'm happy to be in school learning once again.  I see myself
                utilizing skills I learn here at the bootcamp to make a career change into a more technical field.  I am doing my
                best to learn and absorb as much of the material as I possibly can so that I may add it to my arsenal later
                in life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a proud husband and father.  So whenever I am not working or studying, I try to spend as much time with
                them as I can.  If I do get anytime to myself, I will either be on my favorite moba video game or browsing YouTube.
           </p>
